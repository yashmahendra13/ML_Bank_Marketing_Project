# ML Bank Marketing Project
Machine Learning Project to build a prediction model to score customer propensity to subscribe bank products.

Project Data: `https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#`

Methodology: The Customer Propensity ML use case was developed using the CRISP-DM methodology.

The repository is divided into different directory:
- `bin`: The bin directory contains the ML Pipeline written in Python. The pipeline automates the feature engineering and model development using sklearn pipeline package. We can re-use the source code to convert it into a AWS Sagemaker Model or deploy the pipeline for real time applications such as AWS Lambda
- `dev_notebook`: The directory contains the Dev Jupyter notebook featuring Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Selection and building. The univariate analysis html file was generated by pandas-profile package to analize data, correlation and interaction. The TOC contents of the dev notebook highlights the steps taken while building the ML Solution.
- `datasets` - Contains the Raw data and the train/test split data
